Simple Shell Alx C Project
Collaborated by Chuku David Chimezie & Nehemiah Kagwari

Description

This project represents the realization of a shell, which was developed as a Milestone Project as part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering program.
Named "The Gates of Shell," this project was undertaken during the first trimester to enhance students' comprehension of advanced shell programming concepts, encompassing processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, and error handling.
Functioning as a straightforward UNIX command interpreter, this program emulates the core functionalities of the basic shell (sh).
The entire implementation of this project was accomplished using the C programming language.
